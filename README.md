#Machine Learning Eczema Classifer Project

1) Created a Convolutional Neural Network
I trained my own CNN to classify between six types of eczema. I collected over 3000 images for this project and then programmatically annotated each image with a numerical classification that correlates to what type of eczema it is. This dataset was broken into three portion: one for training, one for testing, and one for validation. In my CNN, there were nine layers in the network: seven hidden layers, an input layer, and output layer. I used an 'adam' optimizer from keras, and then did ten epochs with 20 steps per epoch when training the CNN to determine the weights and biases. Finally, I tested my model that I fit with my data on the validation set. While the accuracy was low (due to lack of high-quality data), I learned the ins and outs of using Keras to build a CNN. 

2) Created a Recurrent Neural Network 
I used the ResNet-50 deep-learning model to train an RNN to classify 6 types of eczema. ResNet-50 is a CNN, has 50 layers in its network, and can classify over a 1000 images from the ImageNet. By using transfer learning, I improved the accuracy in comparison to training my own CNN, which didn't have enough high-quality images in the dataset to accurate train the model.
